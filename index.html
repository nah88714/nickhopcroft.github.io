    <H3>Nesting</H3>
    <P>
    Every year, collosal sized sea turtles drag themselves onto beaches all over the world.
    These turtles are pregnant, and they are looking for a place to bury their eggs.
    After digging a hole, they lay hundreds of eggs, and then cover them in sand.
    That is the only interaction these baby turtles will have with their parents.

    <H3>Hatching and Early Life</H3>
    <P>
    A couple of months later, the eggs begin to hatch, and these newborn turtles make a beeline for the ocean.
    Roughly half of the turtles make it to the water (depending on the time of day), due to various predators.
    These newborn turtles then begin a feeding frenzy for the next few days, eating everything they can, although many more are taken by predators.

    <H3>Youth and Adulthood</H3>
    <P>
    These years are known as the lost years in a sea turtle's life.
    The turtles will leave the coastline, going off the raidar for around ten years, until they reach the size of a frisbee.
    In their juvenille years, they continue to forage along the coast, gorwing and maturing.
    About 1% of sea turtles make it to adulthood, or one in every one hundred.
    Once maturity is reached, the turtles begin their adult life, soon beginning the cycle again.
